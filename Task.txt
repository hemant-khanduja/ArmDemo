For this exercise could you implement an MVC.NET Pricing query form in C#.    
 
The form should contain the following fields:
 
First Name - Optional
Last Name - Mandatory
Email - Mandatory
Address -Line 1, City, postcode and  Country mandatory
Phone - Mandatory
Products-  User should be able to select multiple products, selection of at least one product is mandatory
 
After form submission the following actions should happen:
 
1. Pricing query is registered to the database – they will also be retrieved for future reports.
2. Email sales team about the query.
 
A few pointers:
 
-  You should expect to spend no more than two or three hours on this challenge.
-  The code should be of 'production quality'. We will be looking for evidence that it's written to be flexible and maintainable.
-  Be sure to state (or comment) your assumptions.
-  This should be used as an opportunity to showcase your development approach.
